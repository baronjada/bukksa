# Bukksa

> "Bound by books, free in stories."

**Building a better way to track and share your reading journey.**

Bukksa is my self-led passion project: an online book library app inspired by my favourite hobby - reading. It's designed as a long-term project that evolves alongside my growth as a developer.

This app is more than just a portfolio piece — it's a sandbox where I apply and reinforce what I’m learning, from JavaScript fundamentals to front-end frameworks like React (coming soon!).

## How It's Made:

### Tech used:

**Currently:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Coming soon:** React, AI integrations, backend tools (Node.js, Firebase etc)

## Project Vision:

My goal is to create a more intuitive, visually engaging alternative to Goodreads — one that's tailored for modern readers.

Planned features include:

📖 Bookshelves: Organise your reads with labels like “TBR”, “Currently Reading”, “DNF”, and “Want to Read”

⭐ User Reviews & Ratings: Leave thoughtful reviews, rate books, and share them across social platforms

👤 User Accounts: Sign up and track your reading journey

🧠 Smart Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions based on your reading preferences

## Why This Project Matters:

I am building Bukksa to bridge my love for books and front-end development. It serves as a living, breathing portfolio project where I experiment, make mistakes, learn and grow. Over time, I’ll be expanding its functionality and tech stack as my skills evolve.
